## Downstream/Upstream:

In water, the direction along the stream is called downstream. And, the direction against the stream is called upstream.

If the speed of a boat in still water is u km/hr and the speed of the stream is v km/hr, then:

Speed downstream = (u + v) km/hr.

Speed upstream = (u - v) km/hr.

If the speed downstream is a km/hr and the speed upstream is b km/hr, then:

Speed in still water =	1	(a + b) km/hr.
2
Rate of stream =	1	(a - b) km/hr.

## Profit & Loss


- Profit, P = SP – CP; SP>CP

- Loss, L = CP – SP; CP>SP

- P% = (P/CP) x 100

- L% = (L/CP) x 100

- SP = {(100 + P%)/100} x CP

- SP = {(100 – L%)/100} x CP

- CP = {100/(100 + P%)} x SP

- CP = {100/(100 – L%)} x SP

- Discount = MP – SP

- SP = MP -Discou

- For *false weight*, profit percentage will be **P% = (True weight – false weight/ false weight) x 100**.

- When there are two successful profits say m% and n%, then the net percentage *profit* equals to **(m+n+mn)/100**

- When the profit is m% and loss is n%, then the net % profit or loss will be: **(m-n-mn)/100**

- If a product is sold at m% profit and then again sold at n% *profit* then the actual cost price of the product will be:
    **CP = [100 x 100 x P/(100+m)(100+n)]**. In case of *loss*, **CP =[100 x 100 x P/(100-m)(100-n)]**

- If P% and L% are equal then, P = L and **%loss = P^2/100**

## Divisiblty Rule

![](https://github.com/Psingh12354/Apptitude/blob/main/Divisibility%20Rule.jpeg)

### Divisible by 7

To check multiply the number by 5 or 2 and than that number add(if mul by 5) else if mul by 2(subtract) through left number

**eg :** 532 div by 7

**Step 1-**
mul 2x5=10
**Step 2-** 
neglect the unit digit and add to left number
 53|2+10=63 
 
check number divisible if yes than original number is also divisible.

Similary multiply it by 2 and instead addition subtract it.

## Clock

### 1. Minute Spaces

The face or dial of clock is a circle whose circumference is divided into 60 equal parts, named minute spaces.

### 2. Hour hand and minute hand

A clock has two hands. The smaller hand is called the hour hand or short hand and the larger one is called minute hand or long hand.

3. In 60 minutes, minute hand gains 55 minute spaces over the hour hand.

(In 60 minutes, hour hand will move 5 minute spaces while the minute hand will move 60 minute spaces. In effect the space gain of minute hand with respect to hour hand will be 60 - 5 = 55 minutes.)

4. Both the hands of a clock coincide once in every hour.

5. The hands of a clock are in the same straight line when they are coincident or opposite to each other.

6. When the two hands of a clock are at *right angles*, they are *15 minute* spaces apart.

7. When the hands of a clock are in opposite directions, they are 30 minute spaces apart.

8. Angle traced by hour hand in **12 hrs = 360°**

9. Angle traced by minute hand in **60 min. = 360°**.

### 1) What is the LCM of 147/64 and 30/44?

1) 735/2

2) 735/704

3) 3/704

4) 3/735



Solution

```
Option A

Find the LCM of the numerators.

LCM (147, 30) = 1470

Step 2: Find the HCF of denominators.

HCF (64, 44) = 4

So, the LCM of 147/64 and 30/44 is (LCM of Numerators) / (HCF of Denominators) = 1470 / 4 = 735/2
```

### 2) A man rows a boat at a speed of 15 mph in still water. Find the speed of the river if it takes her 4 hours 30 minutes to row a boat to a place 30 miles away and return.

A) 5 mph

B) 10 mph

C) 12 mph

D) 20 mph



Solution

```
Option C

Let the speed of the river=x mph, then

Time taken row 30 miles upstream and 30 miles downstream = 30/(15-x) + 30/(15+x) = 9/2

= 10/(15-x) + 10/(15+x) = 3/2

= 2[10(15+x) + 10(15-x)] = 3(15-x)²

= 300 + 20x + 300 – 20x = 675 -3x²

x² = 25 or x=5
```

### 3) Working 5 hours a day, A can Complete a work in 8 days and working 6 hours a day, B can complete the same work in 10 days. Working 8 hours a day, they can jointly complete the work in how many days?

A) 3 days

B) 4 days

C) 4.5 days

D) 5.4 days



Solution

```
option A

Working 5 hours a day, A can complete the work in 8 days = 5*8 = 40 hours

Working 6 hours a day, B can complete the work in 10 days = 6*10 = 60 hours

(A+B)’s 1 hour’s work = (1/40+1/60)

=(3+2)/120

= 1/24

Hence, A and B can complete the work in 24 hours which is equal to 3 days.
```

### 4) A mixture of 40 liters of milk and water contains 10% water. How much water should be added to this so that water may be 20% in the new mixture?

A) 6.5 liters

B) 5 liters

C) 4 liters

D) 7.5 liters



Solution
```
Option B

A mixture of 40 liters of milk = 36 liters of Milk and 4 liters of water = 90:10 ratio

Now the new mixture should be in the ratio of 80:20

Hence 80% is equivalent to 36 liters (no addition of milk is done)

100% is (36/80)*100 = 45 liters of milk is present in the new mixture

Thus water shall be added= (45 – 36 – 4) = 5 liters of water

### 5) Four different electronic devices make a beep after every 30 minutes, 1 hour, 3/2 hour and 1 hour 45 minutes respectively. All the devices beeped together at 12 noon. They will again beep together at:

A) 12 midnight

B) 3 a.m

C) 6 a.m

D) 9 a.m



Solution

```
Option D

Four different devices beep after every 30 mins, 60 mins, 90 mins and 105 mins.

LCM of 30,60,90 and 105 is 1260.

Which means the devices beep together after every 1260 mins = 1260/60 = 21 hours

Hence 12 noon + 21 hours = 9 a.m
```

### 6) In a 100 m race, A can beat B by 25 m and B can beat C by 4 m. In the same race, A can beat C by?

A) 21 m

B) 26 m

C) 28 m

D) 29 m



Solution

```
Option C

When A travels 100 m, B travels 75 m. Hence A:B = 100:75

When B travels 100 m, C travels 96 m. Hence B:C = 100:96

When B Travels 75 m, C travels (96 x 75)/100 = 72 m

Hence B:C = 75:72.

Therefore, A:B:C = 100:75:72.

So, when A Travels 100 m, C travels 72 m.

Therefore, A beat C by 28 m
```

### 7) In an examination, 70% of students passed in physics, 65% in chemistry, 27% failed in both subjects. The percentage of students who passed is?

A) 62

B) 68

C) 66

D) 69



Solution

```
Option A

70% students passed in physics = 30% failed in Physics.

65% students passed in Chemistry = 35% failed in Chemistry

Percentage of students failed in both subject = 27%.

Percentage of students failed = 35 + 30 – 27

= 38%.

Percentage of students passed = 100 – 38% = 62%
```

### 8) If 15 oxen or 20 cows can eat the grass of a field in 80 days, then in how many days will 6 oxen and 2 cows eat the same grass?

A) 40

B) 60

C)100

D) 160



Solution

```
Option D

15 oxen take 80 days so, 6 oxen take x days

x = 15*80/6 = 200 days

20 oxen also take 80 day. So, 2 cows take y days

y = 20*80/2 = 800 days

Together work will be done in 800*200/(800+200) = 160 days

A) 550

B) 450

C) 350

D) 150



Solution

```
Option B

Going through the options,

Taking Cost Price as Rs 450.

Profit = 650 – 450 = 200

Loss = 350 – 450 = 100

Clearly profit is twice the loss incurred.

Hence, Rs 450 is the correct option.
```

### 12) Ronald and Elan are working on an assignment. Ronald takes 6 hours to type 32 pages on a computer, while Elan takes 5 hours to type 40 pages. How much time will they take, working together on two different computers to type an assignment of 110 pages?

A) 7 hours 30 minutes

B) 8 hours

C) 8 hours 15 minutes

D) 8 hours 25 minutes



Solution

```
Option C

In 1hr, Ronald types = 32/6 pages and Elan types = 40/5 pages

If they work together they will type = 32/6 + 40/5 = 40/3 pages in 1 hr

Time needed  to complete the assignment is = (3 x 110)/40 = 33/4 = 8hrs 15mins

Hence, the time required is 8 hrs 15 mins.
```

### 13) A television manufacturing company has decided to increase the sale to beat the economic slowdown. It decides to reduce the price of television sets by 25% as a result of which the sales increased by 20%. What is the effect on the total revenue of the company?

A) Decreased by 20%

B) Increased by 20%

C) Increased by 10%

D) Decreased by 10%



Solution

```

Option D

Let the initial Price = Rs.100 and initial sales = 100

So, the initial revenue = Rs. 10000

Now, the price is reduced to 25% which is equal to Rs.75 and Sales is increased by 20% which is equal to 120.

Now new revenue = 120 x 75 = Rs. 9000

Change in revenue = (10000 – 9000) = Rs.1000 decrease

% decrease = (1000/10000) x 100 = 10%

Hence, the correct option is decrease of 10%.
```

### 14) Ravi has a bag full of 10 Nestle and 5 Cadbury chocolates. Out of these, he draws two chocolates. What is the probability that he would get at least one Nestle chocolate?

A) 19/21

B) 3/7

C) 2/21

D) 1/3



Solution

```
Option A

Probability of getting atleast one nestle chocolate = [(10C1 x 5C1) + 10C2] / 15C2

[(10 x 5) + (10 x 9)/2] / [(15 x 14)/2] = 19/21.

Hence, the required probability is 19/21.
```

### 15) Anil and Ruhi started a business by investing Rs 2000 and Rs 2800 respectively. After 8 months, Anil added Rs 600 and Ruhi added Rs 400. At the same time Teena joined them with Rs 4200. Find the share of Teena if they get a profit of Rs 34,300 after a year.

A) Rs 7490

B) Rs 7350

C) Rs 8250

D) Rs 8530

E) None of these

Solution

```
Option B

Solution:
Share of Anil : Share of Ruhi : Share of Teena is
2000×8 + 2600×4 : 2800×8 + 3200×4 : 4200×4
33 : 44 : 21
so share of Teena = 21/(33+44+21) × 34300 = Rs 7350

If interest obtained in scheme A after 4 years is Rs 226 more than the interest obtained in scheme B after 2 years, find the part deposited in scheme B.

A) Rs 3200

B) Rs 4500

C) Rs 3800

D) Rs 3500

E) Rs 2800

Solution: 

```
Option C

Solution:
Rs 3800
Solution:
(7000-x)*8*4/100 = x [ (1 + 10/100)2 – 1] + 226
70*8*4 – 32x/100 = 21x/100 + 226
2240 – 226 = 53x/100
2014 = 53x/100
So, x = Rs 3800
```

### 17) A work which is completed by 20 men in 8 days can be completed by 25 women 12 days. 16 men and 10 women start doing the work. After 3 days, they leave. If the remaining work is to be completed in 6 days by x number of men, find x.

A) 16

B) 18

C) 12

D) 10

E) 22

Solution:

```
Option A

Solution: 
20 men in 8 days so 16 men in 20 × 8/16 = 10 days and
25 women in 12 days so 10 women in 25 × 12/10 = 30 days
So in 3 days, they complete (1/10 + 1/30) × 3 = 2/5
So remaining work = 1 – 2/5 = 3/5
20 m 1 work in 8 days and x men 3/5 work in 6 days
So 20 × 8 × 3/5 = x × 6 × 1
So, x = 16 men
```

### 18) There are 140 tickets (numbered 1 to 140) in a bowl. Find the probability of choosing a ticket which bears multiple of either 3 or 7.

A) 3/5

B) 2/9

C) 1/8

D) 3/7

E) None of these

Solution: 

```
Option D

Solution
Number of multiples of 3 in 140 = 140/3 = 46
Number of multiples of 7 in 140 = 140/7 = 20
Number of multiples of 3×7= 21 in 140 = 140/21 = 6
So required probability = (46+20 – 6)/140 = 60/140 = 3/7

1. 192

2. 10

3. 38

4. 2

5. 3

Solution: 

```
3

Solution: 
Logic is 2×1 + 1 = 3, 3 × 2 + 4 =10, 10 × 3 + 9 = 39, 39 × 4 + 16 = 172…. So in place of 38, it should be 39.
```

### 33) Find the greatest 6-digit number, which is a multiple of 12.

1. 999980

2. 999990

3. 999984

4. None of these

Solution: 

```
Greatest six-digit number is 999999. Divide this number by 12 and get remainder as 3. Since the remainder is 3, if you subtract 3 from the number, the remaining number will be a multiple of 12. So the greatest such number will be 999999 – 3 =999996.
```

### 34) What is the sum of all natural numbers between 100 and 200 which are multiples of 3?

1. 5000

2. 4950

3. 4980

4. 4900

5. None of these

Solution:

```
Multiples of 3 between 100 and 200 are 102, 105, 108,â€¦ ,198.
Here, the first term = 102
last term = 198
Let the number of Multiples of 3 between 100 and 200 = n

W.K.T: Arithmetic Progression Formula:
an = a1 + (n - 1)d
Where, an = last term = 198
a1 = first term = 102
d = common difference = 105 - 102 = 3
---> 198 = 102 + (n - 1) * 3
---> 198 - 102 = (n - 1) * 3
---> 96 = (n - 1) * 3
---> (n - 1) = 96/3 = 32
---> n = 32 + 1
---> n = 33

Formula:
Sum of n terms = Sn = (n/2) * (a + l)
where n = number of elements = 33
a = first term = 102
l = last term = 198
Thus, using the above formula, Sum of all natural numbers between 100 and 200 which are multiples of 3 = (33/2) * (102 + 198)
= (33/2) * 300
= 33 * 150
= 4950
```

### 35) The sum of three numbers in an Arithmetic Progression is 45 and their product is 3000. What are the three numbers?

A. 5, 15, 25

B. 12, 15, 18

C. 10, 15, 20

D. -10, -15, -20

Solution:

```
Assuming that the numbers are (a – d), a, (a + d) and their sum is 45, we get the middle number as 15. Now, the product (a – d) (a + d) = 200. Solving, we get d = 5. Therefore, the numbers are 10, 15 and 20.

### 37) After the division of a number successively by 3, 4 and 7, the remainder obtained is 2, 1 and 4 respectively. What will be remainder if 84 divide the same number?

A. 80

B. 75

C. 42

D. 53

Answer: 

```
Option D

Solution: 
As the Number gives a remainder of 4 when it is divided by 7, then the number must be in form of (7x + 4)

The same gives remainder 1 when it is divided 4, so the number must be in the form of {4 × (7x + 4) + 1}

Also, the number when divided by 3 gives remainder 2, thus number must be in form of [3 × {4 × (7x + 4) + 1} + 2]

Now, On simplifying,
[3 × {4 × (7x + 4) + 1} + 2]
= 84x + 53
We get the final number 53 more than a multiple of 84 Hence, if the number is divided by 84,
The remainder will be 53
```

### 38) If the sum of two numbers is 55 and the H.C.F. and L.C.M. of these numbers are 5 and 120 respectively, then the sum of the reciprocals of the numbers is equal to:

### 44) The population of a city A which is 68000 decreases at the rate of 1200/year. Population of city B which is 42000, increases at the rate of 800 per year. Find in how many years, the population of cities A and B are equal?

a. 9 years

b. 10 years

c. 13 years

d. 15 years

Solution: 

```
Correct Option: (c)

We have to find the population of cities A and B after x years.

Step 1: Population of city A = 68000, decreases at the rate of 1200/year
68000 – 1200x

Step 2: Population of city B = 42000, increases at the rate of 800/year
42000 + 800x

Step 3: Find after how many population of cities A and B are equal.

Population of city A = Population of city B
68000 – 1200x = 42000 + 800x
68000 – 42000 = 1200x + 800x
26000 = 2000x
x = 13

### 45) A contractor pays Rs. 20 to a worker for each day and the worker forfeits Rs. 10 for each day if he is idle. At the end of 60 days, the worker gets Rs. 300. Find for how many days the worker was idle?

a. 28 days

b. 30 days

c. 34 days

d. 40 days

Solution:

```
Correct Option: (b)

Step 1: Number of days worked by the worker = 60 and he remained idle for x days. Therefore, number of days worked = (60 – x)

Step 2: Each day he was getting paid Rs. 20. Therefore, the payment received for working days = (60 – x) 20

Step 3: After subtracting the amount which he forfeited, he receives Rs. 300.

Therefore,
(60 – x) 20 – 10x = 300
1200 – 20x – 10x = 300
900 = 30x
x = 30 days
```

### 46) In a farm, along with 50 hens, there were 45 goats and 8 horses and some farmers. If total number of feet be 224 more than number of heads, then find the number of farmers.

a. 11

b. 15

c. 16

d. 18

Solution: 

```
Correct Option: (b)

Let’s the number of farmers be y.

Step 1: Find number of heads
= (50 hens + 45 goats + 8 horses + y farmers)
= (103 + y)

Step 2: Number of feet
= [(Hens 2 × 50) + (45 × 4) + (8 × 4) + (y × 2)]
= [100 + 180 + 32 + 2y]
= 312 + 2y

Step 3: Find number of farmers
(312 + 2y) – (103 + y) = 224
312 + 2y – 103 – y = 224
y = 15

### 50) The speed of a boat in still water is 5km/hr. If the speed of the boat against the stream is 3 km/hr, what is the speed of the stream?

A) 1.5 km/hr

B) 2 km/hr

C) 2.5 km/hr

D) 1 km/hr

Solution:
```
The correct answer is B

Answer with explanation:

Let the speed of stream = X km/hr

Speed of boat = 5 km/hr

Speed upstream = 3km/hr

Apply formula: Speed upstream = speed of boat - speed of stream

∴ 3 = 5 - X

X = 5 - 3 = 2 km/hr
